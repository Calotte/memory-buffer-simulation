# memory-buffer-simulation
A simple storage and buffer manager. Buffer and frame sizes, buffer and frame storage structures, 
page formats, page storage structures, file formats, buffering techniques, hashing techniques, 
file storage structures, and interface functions for the disk space and buffer modules will be implemented. 
The particular technique is chosen from the material covered in class(Advanced Database) that are relevant 
to buffer and storage manager.
